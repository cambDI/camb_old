\title{Combine several predictive models via stacking}
\usage{
caretStack(all.models, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{all.models}{a list of caret models to ensemble.}

\item{optFUN}{the optimization function to use}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass to the optimization function}
}
\value{
S3 caretStack object
}
\description{
Find a good linear combination of several classification or regression models,
using either linear regression, elastic net regression, or greedy optimization.
}
\details{
Every model in the "library" must be a separate \code{train} object.  For
example, if you wish to combine a random forests with several different
values of mtry, you must build a model for each value of mtry.  If you
use several values of mtry in one train model, (e.g. tuneGrid =
expand.grid(.mtry=2:5)), caret will select the best value of mtry
before we get a chance to include it in the ensemble.
