Water solublity (logS) prediction example

In these logS database, the aqueous solubility was expressed as logS, where S is the solubility at a temperature of 20-25°C in mol/L. 
In reference [1], the data afforded by Tetko was used. 
This database includes 1290 organic compounds. 
The data set was converted from the SMILES flat file representation to the MACCS/sdf structured data file. 
In reference [2], some new molecules collected from literature were added. This database includes 1708 molecules
and is used in the QSPR tutorial.
