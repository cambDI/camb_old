  \field{abstract}{%
  This paper deals with the problem of evaluating the predictive ability of
  regression models. In some cases, model validation by internal
  cross-validation technique is not enough and validation by an external test
  set has been suggested as an effective way of evaluating the model predictive
  ability. Different functions for calculating the predictive squared
  correlation coefficient Q2 from an external set were proposed, which lead to
  occasionally different estimates of the model predictive ability and
  therefore to contrasting decisions about model adequacy. In this paper,
  advantages and drawbacks of these functions in estimating model predictive
  ability from some simulated datasets are discussed by comparison. Copyright

  \field{abstract}{%
  Validation is a crucial aspect of any quantitative structure-activity
  relationship ({QSAR)} modeling. This paper examines one of the most popular
  validation criteria, leave-one-out cross-validated R2 ({LOO} q2). Often, a
  high value of this statistical characteristic (q2 {\textgreater} 0.5) is
  considered as a proof of the high predictive ability of the model. In this
  paper, we show that this assumption is generally incorrect. In the case of
  {3D} {QSAR}, the lack of the correlation between the high {LOO} q2 and the
  high predictive ability of a {QSAR} model has been established earlier
  [Pharm. Acta Helv. 70 (1995) 149; J. Chemomet. 10(1996)95; J. Med. Chem. 41
  (1998) 2553]. In this paper, we use two-dimensional ({2D)} molecular
  descriptors and k nearest neighbors ({kNN)} {QSAR} method for the analysis of
  several datasets. No correlation between the values of q2 for the training
  set and predictive ability for the test set was found for any of the
  datasets. Thus, the high value of {LOO} q2 appears to be the necessary but
  not the sufficient condition for the model to have a high predictive power.
  We argue that this is the general property of {QSAR} models developed using
  {LOO} cross-validation. We emphasize that the external validation is the only
  way to establish a reliable {QSAR} model. We formulate a set of criteria for
  evaluation of predictive ability of {QSAR} models.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  This paper emphasizes the importance of rigorous validation as a crucial,
  integral component of Quantitative Structure Property Relationship ({QSPR)}
  model development. We consider some examples of published {QSPR} models,
  which in spite of their high fitted accuracy for the training sets and
  apparent mechanistic appeal, fail rigorous validation tests, and, thus, may
  lack practical utility as reliable screening tools. We present a set of
  simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive {QSPR} models. To
  this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1)
  randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2)
  multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using
  rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight
  the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space
  to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some
  algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of
  these guidelines in the development of predictive {QSPR} models.%
