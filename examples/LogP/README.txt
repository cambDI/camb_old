Water solublity (logS) database 

In logS database, the aqueous solubility was expressed as logS, where S is the solubility at a temperature of 20-25°C in mol/L. These are two databases for our modeling. In reference [1], the data afforded by Tetko was used. This database includes 1290 organic compounds. The data set was converted from the SMILES flat file representation to the MACCS/sdf structured data file. In reference [2], some new molecules collected from literature were added. This database includes 1708 molecules.
