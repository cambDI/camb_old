	abstract = {In this article, we discuss the application of the Gaussian Process method for the prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion ({ADME)} properties. On the basis of a Bayesian probabilistic approach, the method is widely used in the field of machine learning but has rarely been applied in quantitative structure?activity relationship and {ADME} modeling. The method is suitable for modeling nonlinear relationships, does not require subjective determination of the model parameters, works for a large number of descriptors, and is inherently resistant to overtraining. The performance of Gaussian Processes compares well with and often exceeds that of artificial neural networks. Due to these features, the Gaussian Processes technique is eminently suitable for automatic model generationone of the demands of modern drug discovery. Here, we describe the basic concept of the method in the context of regression problems and illustrate its application to the modeling of several {ADME} properties:? blood?brain barrier, {hERG} inhibition, and aqueous solubility at {pH} 7.4. We also compare Gaussian Processes with other modeling techniques.},

	abstract = {Artificial "neural networks" are widely used as flexible models for classification and regression applications, but questions remain about how the power of these models can be safely exploited when training data is limited. This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the "overfitting" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David {MacKay's} groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

Careful filtering of the data was required because {ChEMBL} contains unit-transcription errors, undifferentiated stereoisomers, and repeated citations of single measurements (90\% of all pairs). The experimental uncertainty is estimated to yield a mean error of 0.44 {pKi} units, a standard deviation of 0.54 {pKi} units, and a median error of 0.34 {pKi} units.

	abstract = {Different molecular descriptors capture different aspects of molecular structures, but this effect has not yet been quantified systematically on a large scale. In this work, we calculate the similarity of 37 descriptors by repeatedly selecting query compounds and ranking the rest of the database. Euclidean distances between the rank-ordering of different descriptors are calculated to determine descriptor (as opposed to compound) similarity, followed by {PCA} for visualization. Four broad descriptor classes are identified, which are circular fingerprints; circular fingerprints considering counts; path-based and keyed fingerprints; and pharmacophoric descriptors. Descriptor behavior is much more defined by those four classes than the particular parametrization. Using counts instead of the presence/absence of fingerprints significantly changes descriptor behavior, which is crucial for performance of topological autocorrelation vectors, but not circular fingerprints. Four-point pharmacophores ({piDAPH4)} surprisingly lead to much higher retrieval rates than three-point pharmacophores (28.21\% vs 19.15\%) but still similar rank-ordering of compounds (retrieval of similar actives). Looking into individual rankings, circular fingerprints seem more appropriate than path-based fingerprints if complex ring systems or branching patterns are present; count-based fingerprints could be more suitable in databases with a large number of repeated subunits (amide bonds, sugar rings, terpenes). Information-based selection of diverse fingerprints for consensus scoring ({ECFP4/TGD} fingerprints) led only to marginal improvement over single fingerprint results. While it seems to be nontrivial to exploit orthogonal descriptor behavior to improve retrieval rates in consensus virtual screening, those descriptors still each retrieve different actives which corroborates the strategy of employing diverse descriptors individually in prospective virtual screening settings.},

The descriptions were correlated to the susceptibility data of 828 unique {HIV} protease variants for seven protease inhibitors in current use; the data set comprised 4792 protease-inhibitor combinations.},

We show by theoretical argument and empiric study of a large {QSAR} data set that when the available sample size is smallin the dozens or scores rather than the hundreds, holding a portion of it back for testing is wasteful, and that it is much better to use cross-validation, but ensure that this is done properly.},

	abstract = {Validation is a crucial aspect of any quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)} modeling. This paper examines one of the most popular validation criteria, leave-one-out cross-validated R2 ({LOO} q2). Often, a high value of this statistical characteristic (q2 {\textgreater} 0.5) is considered as a proof of the high predictive ability of the model. In this paper, we show that this assumption is generally incorrect. In the case of {3D} {QSAR}, the lack of the correlation between the high {LOO} q2 and the high predictive ability of a {QSAR} model has been established earlier [Pharm. Acta Helv. 70 (1995) 149; J. Chemomet. 10(1996)95; J. Med. Chem. 41 (1998) 2553]. In this paper, we use two-dimensional ({2D)} molecular descriptors and k nearest neighbors ({kNN)} {QSAR} method for the analysis of several datasets. No correlation between the values of q2 for the training set and predictive ability for the test set was found for any of the datasets. Thus, the high value of {LOO} q2 appears to be the necessary but not the sufficient condition for the model to have a high predictive power. We argue that this is the general property of {QSAR} models developed using {LOO} cross-validation. We emphasize that the external validation is the only way to establish a reliable {QSAR} model. We formulate a set of criteria for evaluation of predictive ability of {QSAR} models.},

We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive {QSPR} models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of these guidelines in the development of predictive {QSPR} models.},

The data were subjected to proteochemometrics modeling, concomitantly modeling all peptides on all the four dengue proteases, which yielded highly predictive models for both activities. Detailed analysis of the models then showed that considerably differing physico-chemical properties of amino acids contribute independently to the K(m) and k(cat) activities. For k(cat), only P1' and P2' prime side residues were important, while for K(m) all four prime side residues, P1'-P4', were important. The models could be used to identify amino acids for each P' substrate position that are favorable for, respectively, high substrate affinity and cleavage rate.},

					bioactivity spectra of 92 chemical compounds with 47 unique {HIV-1} protease variants. In contrast to other {PCM} models, which used
					Multiplication of Ligands and Proteins Descriptors ({MLPD)} as cross-term, one new cross-term, i.e. Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprint

abstract  ="{'}Proteochemometric modeling{'} is a bioactivity modeling technique founded on the description of both small molecules (the ligands){,} and proteins (the targets). By
combining those two elements of a ligand - target interaction proteochemometrics techniques model the interaction complex or the full ligand - target interaction space{,} and they
are able to quantify the similarity between both ligands and targets simultaneously. Consequently{,} proteochemometric models or complex based models{,} can be considered an
extension of QSAR models{,} which are ligand based. As proteochemometric models are able to incorporate target information they outperform conventional QSAR models when
extrapolating from the activities of known ligands on known targets to novel targets. Vice versa{,} proteochemometrics can be used to virtually screen for selective compounds that
are solely active on a single member of a subfamily of targets{,} as well as to select compounds with a desired bioactivity profile - a topic particularly relevant with concepts
such as {'}ligand polypharmacology{'} in mind. Here we illustrate the concept of proteochemometrics and provide a review of relevant methodological publications in the field. We
give an overview of the target families proteochemometrics modeling has previously been applied to{,} and introduce some novel application areas of the modeling technique. We
conclude that proteochemometrics is a promising technique in preclinical drug research that allows merging data sets that were previously considered separately{,} with the
potential to extrapolate more reliably both in ligand as well as target space."}

Robust statistical tests (bootstrap and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics) were employed to evaluate the significance of calculated models. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the performance of methods. Individual structure-complexation property models obtained with nonlinear methods demonstrated a significantly better performance than the models built using multilinear regression analysis ({MLRA).} However, the averaging of several {MLRA} models based on {SMF} descriptors provided as good of a prediction as the most efficient nonlinear techniques. Support Vector Machines and Associative Neural Networks contributed in the largest number of significant models.

Whereas excellent fit to the training data may be readily attainable, often models fail to predict accurately chemicals that are outside their domain of applicability. A {QSAR's} utility and, in the case of regulatory decisions, justification for usage increasingly depend on the ability to quantify a model's potential for predicting unknown chemicals with some known degree of certainty. It is never possible to predict an unknown chemical with absolute certainty. Here we report on two {QSAR} models based on different data sets for classification of chemicals according to their ability to bind to the estrogen receptor. The models were developed by using a novel {QSAR} method, Decision Forest, which combines the results of multiple heterogeneous but comparable Decision Tree models to produce a consensus prediction. We used an extensive cross-validation process to define an applicability domain for model predictions based on two quantitative measures: prediction confidence and domain extrapolation. Together, these measures quantify the accuracy of each prediction within and outside of the training domain. Despite being based on large and diverse training sets, both {QSAR} models had poor accuracy for chemicals within the domain of low confidence, whereas good accuracy was obtained for those within the domain of high confidence. For prediction in the high confidence domain, accuracy was inversely proportional to the degree of domain extrapolation. The model with a larger training set of 1,092, compared with 232 for the other, was more accurate in predicting chemicals at larger domain extrapolation, and could be particularly useful for rapidly prioritizing potential endocrine disruptors from large chemical universe.},

	abstract = {A model, {VLOGP}, has been developed for assessment of n-octanol/water partition coefficient, log P, of chemicals from their structures. Unlike group contribution methods, {VLOGP} is based on linear free energy relationship ({LFER)} approach and employs information-rich electrotopological structure quantifiers derived solely from molecular topology. {VLOGP}, a robust and cross-validated model derived from accurately measured experimental log P values of 6675 diverse chemicals, has a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.986 and a standard error of estimate of 0.20. When applied to the training set, the largest deviation observed between experimental and calculated log P was 0.42. {VLOGP} is different from other log P predictors in that its application domain, called Optimum Prediction Space ({OPS)}, has been quantitatively defined, i.e., structures to which the model should not be applied for predicting log P can be identified. A computer-assisted implementation of this model within {HDi's} toxicity assessment software package, {TOPKAT} 3.0, automatically checks whether the submitted structure is inside the {OPS} or not. {VLOGP} was applied to a set of 113 chemicals not included in the training set. It was observed that for the structures inside the {OPS} the average deviation between experimental and model-calculated log P values is 0.27, whereas the corresponding deviation for structures outside the {OPS} is 1.35. This demonstrates the necessity of identifying the structures to which a model is not applicable before accepting a model-based predicted log P value. For a set of 47 nucleosides, the performance of {VLOGP} was compared with that of four published log P predictors; a standard deviation of 0.33 was obtained with {VLOGP}, whereas the standard deviation from other log P predictors ranged between 0.46 and 1.20.},

The practical application of the {AD} concept requires an operational definition that permits the design of an automatic (computerised), quantitative procedure to determine a models {AD.} An attempt is made to address this need, and methods and criteria for estimating {AD} through training set interpolation in descriptor space are reviewed. It is proposed that response space should be included in the training set representation. Thus, training set chemicals are points in n-dimensional descriptor space and m-dimensional model response space. Four major approaches for estimating interpolation regions in a multivariate space are reviewed and compared: range, distance, geometrical, and probability density distribution.},

	abstract = {How well can a {QSAR} model predict the activity of a molecule not in the training set used to create the model? A set of retrospective cross-validation experiments using 20 diverse in-house activity sets were done to find a good discriminator of prediction accuracy as measured by root-mean-square difference between observed and predicted activity. Among the measures we tested, two seem useful: the similarity of the molecule to be predicted to the nearest molecule in the training set and/or the number of neighbors in the training set, where neighbors are those more similar than a user-chosen cutoff. The molecules with the highest similarity and/or the most neighbors are the best-predicted. This trend holds true for narrow training sets and, to a lesser degree, for many diverse training sets and does not depend on which {QSAR} method or descriptor is used. One may define the similarity using a different descriptor than that used for the {QSAR} model. The similarity dependence for diverse training sets is somewhat unexpected. It appears to be greater for those data sets where the association of similar activities vs similar structures (as encoded in the Patterson plot) is stronger. We propose a way to estimate the reliability of the prediction of an arbitrary chemical structure on a given {QSAR} model, given the training set from which the model was derived.},

	abstract = {The biochemical half maximal inhibitory concentration ({IC50)} is the most commonly used metric for on-target activity in lead optimization. It is used to guide lead optimization, build large-scale chemogenomics analysis, off-target activity and toxicity models based on public data. However, the use of public biochemical {IC50} data is problematic, because they are assay specific and comparable only under certain conditions. For large scale analysis it is not feasible to check each data entry manually and it is very tempting to mix all available {IC50} values from public database even if assay information is not reported. As previously reported for Ki database analysis, we first analyzed the types of errors, the redundancy and the variability that can be found in {ChEMBL} {IC50} database. For assessing the variability of {IC50} data independently measured in two different labs at least ten {IC50} data for identical protein-ligand systems against the same target were searched in {ChEMBL.} As a not sufficient number of cases of this type are available, the variability of {IC50} data was assessed by comparing all pairs of independent {IC50} measurements on identical protein-ligand systems. The standard deviation of {IC50} data is only 25\% larger than the standard deviation of Ki data, suggesting that mixing {IC50} data from different assays, even not knowing assay conditions details, only adds a moderate amount of noise to the overall data. The standard deviation of public {ChEMBL} {IC50} data, as expected, resulted greater than the standard deviation of in-house intra-laboratory/inter-day {IC50} data. Augmenting mixed public {IC50} data by public Ki data does not deteriorate the quality of the mixed {IC50} data, if the Ki is corrected by an offset. For a broad dataset such as {ChEMBL} database a Ki- {IC50} conversion factor of 2 was found to be the most reasonable.},

We discover that the accuracy of a decision tree classifier can be much improved if the whole pdf, rather than a simple statistic, is taken into account.

	abstract = {Quantitative predictions in computational life sciences are often based on regression models. The advent of machine learning has led to highly accurate regression models that have gained widespread acceptance. While there are statistical methods available to estimate the global performance of regression models on a test or training dataset, it is often not clear how well this performance transfers to other datasets or how reliable an individual prediction is–a fact that often reduces a user’s trust into a computational method. In analogy to the concept of an experimental error, we sketch how estimators for individual prediction errors can be used to provide confidence intervals for individual predictions. Two novel statistical methods, named {CONFINE} and {CONFIVE}, can estimate the reliability of an individual prediction based on the local properties of nearby training data. The methods can be applied equally to linear and non-linear regression methods with very little computational overhead. We compare our confidence estimators with other existing confidence and applicability domain estimators on two biologically relevant problems ({MHC–peptide} binding prediction and quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)).} Our results suggest that the proposed confidence estimators perform comparable to or better than previously proposed estimation methods. Given a sufficient amount of training data, the estimators exhibit error estimates of high quality. In addition, we observed that the quality of estimated confidence intervals is predictable. We discuss how confidence estimation is influenced by noise, the number of features, and the dataset size. Estimating the confidence in individual prediction in terms of error intervals represents an important step from plain, non-informative predictions towards transparent and interpretable predictions that will help to improve the acceptance of computational methods in the biological community.},

It is of utmost importance that these proteins be characterized if we are to develop combative strategies against malaria based on the biology of the parasite. In an attempt to infer protein function on a genome-wide scale, we computationally modeled the P. falciparum interactome, elucidating local and global functional relationships between gene products. The resulting interaction network, reconstructed by integrating in silico and experimental functional genomics data within a Bayesian framework, covers approximately 68\% of the parasite genome and provides functional inferences for more than 2000 uncharacterized proteins, based on their associations. Network reconstruction involved the use of a novel strategy, where we incorporated continuously updated, uniform reference priors in our Bayesian model. This method for generating interaction maps is thus also well suited for application to other genomes, where pre-existing interactome knowledge is sparse. Additionally, we superimposed this map on genomes of three apicomplexan pathogens--Plasmodium yoelii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium parvum--describing relationships between these organisms based on retained functional linkages. This comparison provided a glimpse of the highly evolved nature of P. falciparum; for instance, a deficit of nearly 26\% in terms of predicted interactions is observed against P. yoelii, because of missing ortholog partners in pairs of functionally linked proteins.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of ‘privileged’ substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial.
Results: Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed ‘underprivileged’ substructures and ‘conditional privilege’—rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.

In fact, with current technologies, the enthalpic optimization of drug candidates may take years and only appear in second-generation products. Within that context, it is not surprising that structure/activity relationships ({SAR)} that explicitly incorporate the interplay between enthalpy and entropy and accelerate the optimization process are being developed and gaining popularity.},

This is certainly true for {HIV}, and hence, it is often unknown which drug is best to use or to develop against an individual {HIV} strain. In this work we applied ‘proteochemometric’ modeling of {HIV} Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase ({NNRTI)} inhibitors to support preclinical development by predicting compound performance on multiple mutants in the lead selection stage. Proteochemometric models are based on both small molecule and target properties and can thus capture multi-target activity relationships simultaneously, the targets in this case being a set of 14 {HIV} Reverse Transcriptase ({RT)} mutants. We validated our model by experimentally confirming model predictions for 317 untested compound – mutant pairs, with a prediction error comparable with assay variability ({RMSE} 0.62). Furthermore, dependent on the similarity of a new mutant to the training set, we could predict with high accuracy which compound will be most effective on a sequence with a previously unknown genotype. Hence, our models allow the evaluation of compound performance on untested sequences and the selection of the most promising leads for further preclinical research. The modeling concept is likely to be applicable also to other target families with genetic variability like other viruses or bacteria, or with similar orthologs like {GPCRs.}},

	abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs)} are the most frequently addressed drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry. However, achieving highly safety and efficacy in designing of {GPCR} drugs is quite challenging since their primary amino acid sequences show fairly high homology. Systematic study on the interaction spectra of inhibitors with multiple human {GPCRs} will shed light on how to design the inhibitors for different diseases which are related to {GPCRs.} To reach this goal, several proteochemometric models were constructed based on different combinations of two protein descriptors, two ligand descriptors and one ligand-receptor cross-term by two kinds of statistical learning techniques. Our results show that support vector regression ({SVR)} performs better than Gaussian processes ({GP)} for most combinations of descriptors. The transmembrane ({TM)} identity descriptors have more powerful ability than the z-scale descriptors in the characterization of {GPCRs.} Furthermore, the performance of our {PCM} models was not improved by introducing the cross-terms. Finally, based on the {TM} Identity descriptors and 28-dimensional drug-like index, two best {PCM} models with {GP} and {SVR} ({GP-S-DLI:} R(2)=0.9345, Q(2)test=0.7441; {SVR-S-DLI:} R(2)=1.0000, Q(2)test=0.7423) were derived respectively. The area of {ROC} curve was 0.8940 when an external test set was used, which indicates that our {PCM} model obtained a powerful capability for predicting new interactions between {GPCRs} and ligands. Our results indicate that the derived best model has a high predictive ability for human {GPCR-inhibitor} interactions. It can be potentially used to discover novel multi-target or specific inhibitors of {GPCRs} with higher efficacy and fewer side effects.},

We furthermore outline methods for target prediction that exist, both based on the knowledge of bioactivities from the ligand side and methods that can be applied in situations when a protein structure is known. Applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in detail, which were based partly or in whole on computational target predictions in the first instance. This includes the authors' own experience using target prediction tools, in this case considering phenotypic antibacterial screens and the analysis of high-throughput screening data.

	abstract = {Virtual filtering and screening of combinatorial libraries have recently gained attention as methods complementing the high-throughput screening and combinatorial chemistry. These chemoinformatic techniques rely heavily on quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)} analysis, a field with established methodology and successful history. In this review, we discuss the computational methods for building {QSAR} models. We start with outlining their usefulness in high-throughput screening and identifying the general scheme of a {QSAR} model. Following, we focus on the methodologies in constructing three main components of {QSAR} model, namely the methods for describing the molecular structure of compounds, for selection of informative descriptors and for activity prediction. We present both the well-established methods as well as techniques recently introduced into the {QSAR} domain.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryUnderstanding} how chromosomes fold provides insights into the complex relationship among chromatin structure, gene activity and the functional state of the cell. Recently, chromosome conformation capture based technologies, such as Hi-C and {TCC}, have been developed to provide a genome-wide, high resolution and three-dimensional ({3D)} view of chromatin organization. However, statistical methods for analyzing these data are still under development. Here we propose two Bayesian methods, {BACH} to infer the consensus {3D} chromosomal structure and {BACH-MIX} to reveal structural variations of chromatin in a cell population. Applying {BACH} and {BACH-MIX} to a high resolution Hi-C dataset, we found that most local genomic regions exhibit homogeneous {3D} chromosomal structures. Furthermore, spatial properties of {3D} chromosomal structures and structural variations of chromatin are associated with several genomic and epigenetic features. Noticeably, gene rich, accessible and early replicated genomic regions tend to be more elongated and exhibit higher structural variations than gene poor, inaccessible and late replicated genomic regions.},

								abstract = {In this study, two probabilistic machine-learning algorithms were compared for in silico target prediction of bioactive molecules, namely the well-established Laplacian-modified Naïve Bayes classifier ({NB)} and the more recently introduced (to Cheminformatics) Parzen-Rosenblatt Window. Both classifiers were trained in conjunction with circular fingerprints on a large data set of bioactive compounds extracted from {ChEMBL}, covering 894 human
									protein targets with more than 155,000 ligand-protein pairs. This data set is also provided as a benchmark data set for future target prediction methods due to its size as well as the number of bioactivity classes it contains. In addition to evaluating the methods, different performance measures were explored. This is not as straightforward as in binary classification settings, due to the number of classes, the possibility of multiple class memberships,
									and the need to translate model scores into ?yes/no? predictions for assessing model performance. Both algorithms achieved a recall of correct targets that exceeds 80\% in the top 1\% of predictions. Performance depends significantly on the underlying diversity and size of a given class of bioactive compounds, with small classes and low structural similarity affecting both algorithms to different degrees. When tested on an external test set extracted
										from {WOMBAT} covering more than 500 targets by excluding all compounds with Tanimoto similarity above 0.8 to compounds from the {ChEMBL} data set, the current methodologies achieved a recall of 63.3\% and 66.6\% among the top 1\% for Naïve Bayes and Parzen-Rosenblatt Window, respectively. While those numbers seem to indicate lower performance, they are also more realistic for settings where protein targets need to be established for novel
										chemical substances.},

						abstract = {The most effective way to move from target identification to the clinic is to identify already approved drugs with the potential for activating or inhibiting unintended targets (repurposing or repositioning). This is usually achieved by high throughput chemical screening, transcriptome matching, or simple in silico ligand docking. We now describe a novel rapid computational proteochemometric method called "train, match, fit, streamline" ({TMFS)} to map
							new drug-target interaction space and predict new uses. The {TMFS} method combines shape, topology, and chemical signatures, including docking score and functional contact points of the ligand, to predict potential drug-target interactions with remarkable accuracy. Using the {TMFS} method, we performed extensive molecular fit computations on 3671 {FDA} approved drugs across 2335 human protein crystal structures. The {TMFS} method predicts drug-target
								associations with 91\% accuracy for the majority of drugs. Over 58\% of the known best ligands for each target were correctly predicted as top ranked, followed by 66\%, 76\%, 84\%, and 91\% for agents ranked in the top 10, 20, 30, and 40, respectively, out of all 3671 drugs. Drugs ranked in the top 1-40 that have not been experimentally validated for a particular target now become candidates for repositioning. Furthermore, we used the {TMFS} method to
								discover that mebendazole, an antiparasitic with recently discovered and unexpected anticancer properties, has the structural potential to inhibit {VEGFR2.} We confirmed experimentally that mebendazole inhibits {VEGFR2} kinase activity and angiogenesis at doses comparable with its known effects on hookworm. {TMFS} also predicted, and was confirmed with surface plasmon resonance, that dimethyl celecoxib and the anti-inflammatory agent celecoxib can
								bind cadherin-11, an adhesion molecule important in rheumatoid arthritis and poor prognosis malignancies for which no targeted therapies exist. We anticipate that expanding our {TMFS} method to the {\textgreater}27 000 clinically active agents available worldwide across all targets will be most useful in the repositioning of existing drugs for new therapeutic targets.},
