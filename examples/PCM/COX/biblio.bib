abstract = {In this article, we discuss the application of the Gaussian Process method for the prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion ({ADME)} properties. On the basis of a Bayesian probabilistic approach, the method is widely used in the field of machine learning but has rarely been applied in quantitative structure?activity relationship and {ADME} modeling. The method is suitable for modeling nonlinear relationships, does not require subjective determination of the model parameters, works for a large number of descriptors, and is inherently resistant to overtraining. The performance of Gaussian Processes compares well with and often exceeds that of artificial neural networks. Due to these features, the Gaussian Processes technique is eminently suitable for automatic model generationone of the demands of modern drug discovery. Here, we describe the basic concept of the method in the context of regression problems and illustrate its application to the modeling of several {ADME} properties:? blood?brain barrier, {hERG} inhibition, and aqueous solubility at {pH} 7.4. We also compare Gaussian Processes with other modeling techniques.},

abstract = {Artificial "neural networks" are widely used as flexible models for classification and regression applications, but questions remain about how the power of these models can be safely exploited when training data is limited. This book demonstrates how Bayesian methods allow complex neural network models to be used without fear of the "overfitting" that can occur with traditional training methods. Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence.},

title = {{Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms}},
isbn = {9780521642989},
abstract = {Information theory and inference, often taught separately, are here united in one entertaining textbook. These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David {MacKay's} groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning.},

Consequently, experimental uncertainty defines a natural upper limit to the predictive performance possible. Models that yield errors smaller than the experimental uncertainty are necessarily overtrained. A reliable estimate of the experimental uncertainty is therefore of high importance to all originators and users of in silico models. The data deposited in {ChEMBL} was analyzed for reproducibility, i.e., the experimental uncertainty of independent measurements. Careful filtering of the data was required because {ChEMBL} contains unit-transcription errors, undifferentiated stereoisomers, and repeated citations of single measurements (90\% of all pairs). The experimental uncertainty is estimated to yield a mean error of 0.44 {pKi} units, a standard deviation of 0.54 {pKi} units, and a median error of 0.34 {pKi} units. The maximum possible squared Pearson correlation coefficient (R2) on large data sets is estimated to be 0.81.},

doi = {10.1021/ci800249s},
abstract = {Different molecular descriptors capture different aspects of molecular structures, but this effect has not yet been quantified systematically on a large scale. In this work, we calculate the similarity of 37 descriptors by repeatedly selecting query compounds and ranking the rest of the database. Euclidean distances between the rank-ordering of different descriptors are calculated to determine descriptor (as opposed to compound) similarity, followed by {PCA} for visualization. Four broad descriptor classes are identified, which are circular fingerprints; circular fingerprints considering counts; path-based and keyed fingerprints; and pharmacophoric descriptors. Descriptor behavior is much more defined by those four classes than the particular parametrization. Using counts instead of the presence/absence of fingerprints significantly changes descriptor behavior, which is crucial for performance of topological autocorrelation vectors, but not circular fingerprints. Four-point pharmacophores ({piDAPH4)} surprisingly lead to much higher retrieval rates than three-point pharmacophores (28.21\% vs 19.15\%) but still similar rank-ordering of compounds (retrieval of similar actives). Looking into individual rankings, circular fingerprints seem more appropriate than path-based fingerprints if complex ring systems or branching patterns are present; count-based fingerprints could be more suitable in databases with a large number of repeated subunits (amide bonds, sugar rings, terpenes). Information-based selection of diverse fingerprints for consensus scoring ({ECFP4/TGD} fingerprints) led only to marginal improvement over single fingerprint results. While it seems to be nontrivial to exploit orthogonal descriptor behavior to improve retrieval rates in consensus virtual screening, those descriptors still each retrieve different actives which corroborates the strategy of employing diverse descriptors individually in prospective virtual screening settings.},

This was used to characterize pharmacological relationships of Family {A/Rhodopsin} family {GPCRs}, minimizing evolutionary influence from parts of the receptor that do not generally affect ligand binding. The resultant dendogram tended to group receptors according to endogenous ligand types, although it revealed subdivision of certain classes, notably peptide and lipid receptors. The transmembrane binding site reference set, particularly when coupled with a means of identifying the subset of ligand binding residues, provides a general paradigm for understanding the pharmacology/selectivity profile of ligands at Family A {GPCRs.} This has wide applicability to {GPCR} drug design problems across many disease areas.},

We show by theoretical argument and empiric study of a large {QSAR} data set that when the available sample size is smallin the dozens or scores rather than the hundreds, holding a portion of it back for testing is wasteful, and that it is much better to use cross-validation, but ensure that this is done properly.},

abstract = {Validation is a crucial aspect of any quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)} modeling. This paper examines one of the most popular validation criteria, leave-one-out cross-validated R2 ({LOO} q2). Often, a high value of this statistical characteristic (q2 {\textgreater} 0.5) is considered as a proof of the high predictive ability of the model. In this paper, we show that this assumption is generally incorrect. In the case of {3D} {QSAR}, the lack of the correlation between the high {LOO} q2 and the high predictive ability of a {QSAR} model has been established earlier [Pharm. Acta Helv. 70 (1995) 149; J. Chemomet. 10(1996)95; J. Med. Chem. 41 (1998) 2553]. In this paper, we use two-dimensional ({2D)} molecular descriptors and k nearest neighbors ({kNN)} {QSAR} method for the analysis of several datasets. No correlation between the values of q2 for the training set and predictive ability for the test set was found for any of the datasets. Thus, the high value of {LOO} q2 appears to be the necessary but not the sufficient condition for the model to have a high predictive power. We argue that this is the general property of {QSAR} models developed using {LOO} cross-validation. We emphasize that the external validation is the only way to establish a reliable {QSAR} model. We formulate a set of criteria for evaluation of predictive ability of {QSAR} models.},

We consider some examples of published {QSPR} models, which in spite of their high fitted accuracy for the training sets and apparent mechanistic appeal, fail rigorous validation tests, and, thus, may lack practical utility as reliable screening tools. We present a set of simple guidelines for developing validated and predictive {QSPR} models. To this end, we discuss several validation strategies including (1) randomization of the modelled property, also called Y-scrambling, (2) multiple leave-many-out cross-validations, and (3) external validation using rational division of a dataset into training and test sets. We also highlight the need to establish the domain of model applicability in the chemical space to flag molecules for which predictions may be unreliable, and discuss some algorithms that can be used for this purpose. We advocate the broad use of these guidelines in the development of predictive {QSPR} models.},

A set of 48 internally quenched peptides were designed using statistical molecular design ({SMD)} and assayed with proteases of four subtypes of dengue virus ({DEN-1-4)} for Michaelis (K(m)) and cleavage rate constants (k(cat)). The data were subjected to proteochemometrics modeling, concomitantly modeling all peptides on all the four dengue proteases, which yielded highly predictive models for both activities. Detailed analysis of the models then showed that considerably differing physico-chemical properties of amino acids contribute independently to the K(m) and k(cat) activities. For k(cat), only P1' and P2' prime side residues were important, while for K(m) all four prime side residues, P1'-P4', were important. The models could be used to identify amino acids for each P' substrate position that are favorable for, respectively, high substrate affinity and cleavage rate.},

abstract = {{HIV-1} protease is one of the main therapeutic targets in {HIV.} However, a major problem in treatment of {HIV} is the rapid
emergence of drug-resistant strains. It should be particularly helpful to clinical therapy of {AIDS} if one method can be used to predict
antivirus capability of compounds for different variants. In our study, proteochemometric ({PCM)} models were created to study the
bioactivity spectra of 92 chemical compounds with 47 unique {HIV-1} protease variants. In contrast to other {PCM} models, which used
Multiplication of Ligands and Proteins Descriptors ({MLPD)} as cross-term, one new cross-term, i.e. Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprint
({PLIF)} was introduced in our modeling. With different combinations of ligand descriptors, protein descriptors and cross-terms, nine {PCM}
models were obtained, and six of them achieved good predictive abilities (Q2test{\textgreater}0.7). These results showed that the
performance of {PCM} models could be improved when ligand and protein descriptors were complemented by the newly introduced cross-term
{PLIF.} Compared with the conventional cross-term {MLPD}, the newly introduced {PLIF} had a better predictive ability. Furthermore, our best
model ({GD} \& P \& {PLIF:} Q2test = 0.8271) could select out those inhibitors which have a broad antiviral activity. As a conclusion, our
study indicates that proteochemometric modeling with {PLIF} as cross-term is a potential useful way to solve the {HIV-1} drug-resistant

The methods were tested on three types of descriptors: molecular descriptors including E-state values, counts of atoms determined for E-state atom types, and substructural molecular fragments ({SMF).} Comparison of the models was performed using a 5-fold external cross-validation procedure. Robust statistical tests (bootstrap and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics) were employed to evaluate the significance of calculated models. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the performance of methods. Individual structure-complexation property models obtained with nonlinear methods demonstrated a significantly better performance than the models built using multilinear regression analysis ({MLRA).} However, the averaging of several {MLRA} models based on {SMF} descriptors provided as good of a prediction as the most efficient nonlinear techniques. Support Vector Machines and Associative Neural Networks contributed in the largest number of significant models. Models based on fragments ({SMF} descriptors and E-state counts) had higher prediction ability than those based on E-state indices. The use of {SMF} descriptors and E-state counts provided similar results, whereas E-state indices lead to less significant models. The current study illustrates the difficulties of quantitative comparison of different methods: conclusions based only on one data set without appropriate statistical tests could be wrong.},

issn = {0091-6765},
abstract = {Quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)} methods have been widely applied in drug discovery, lead optimization, toxicity prediction, and regulatory decisions. Despite major advances in algorithms and software, {QSAR} models have inherent limitations associated with a size and chemical-structure diversity of the training set, experimental error, and many characteristics of structure representation and correlation algorithms. Whereas excellent fit to the training data may be readily attainable, often models fail to predict accurately chemicals that are outside their domain of applicability. A {QSAR's} utility and, in the case of regulatory decisions, justification for usage increasingly depend on the ability to quantify a model's potential for predicting unknown chemicals with some known degree of certainty. It is never possible to predict an unknown chemical with absolute certainty. Here we report on two {QSAR} models based on different data sets for classification of chemicals according to their ability to bind to the estrogen receptor. The models were developed by using a novel {QSAR} method, Decision Forest, which combines the results of multiple heterogeneous but comparable Decision Tree models to produce a consensus prediction. We used an extensive cross-validation process to define an applicability domain for model predictions based on two quantitative measures: prediction confidence and domain extrapolation. Together, these measures quantify the accuracy of each prediction within and outside of the training domain. Despite being based on large and diverse training sets, both {QSAR} models had poor accuracy for chemicals within the domain of low confidence, whereas good accuracy was obtained for those within the domain of high confidence. For prediction in the high confidence domain, accuracy was inversely proportional to the degree of domain extrapolation. The model with a larger training set of 1,092, compared with 232 for the other, was more accurate in predicting chemicals at larger domain extrapolation, and could be particularly useful for rapidly prioritizing potential endocrine disruptors from large chemical universe.},

abstract = {A model, {VLOGP}, has been developed for assessment of n-octanol/water partition coefficient, log P, of chemicals from their structures. Unlike group contribution methods, {VLOGP} is based on linear free energy relationship ({LFER)} approach and employs information-rich electrotopological structure quantifiers derived solely from molecular topology. {VLOGP}, a robust and cross-validated model derived from accurately measured experimental log P values of 6675 diverse chemicals, has a coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.986 and a standard error of estimate of 0.20. When applied to the training set, the largest deviation observed between experimental and calculated log P was 0.42. {VLOGP} is different from other log P predictors in that its application domain, called Optimum Prediction Space ({OPS)}, has been quantitatively defined, i.e., structures to which the model should not be applied for predicting log P can be identified. A computer-assisted implementation of this model within {HDi's} toxicity assessment software package, {TOPKAT} 3.0, automatically checks whether the submitted structure is inside the {OPS} or not. {VLOGP} was applied to a set of 113 chemicals not included in the training set. It was observed that for the structures inside the {OPS} the average deviation between experimental and model-calculated log P values is 0.27, whereas the corresponding deviation for structures outside the {OPS} is 1.35. This demonstrates the necessity of identifying the structures to which a model is not applicable before accepting a model-based predicted log P value. For a set of 47 nucleosides, the performance of {VLOGP} was compared with that of four published log P predictors; a standard deviation of 0.33 was obtained with {VLOGP}, whereas the standard deviation from other log P predictors ranged between 0.46 and 1.20.},

abstract = {As the use of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship ({QSAR)} models for chemical management increases, the reliability of the predictions from such models is a matter of growing concern. The {OECD} {QSAR} Validation Principles recommend that a model should be used within its applicability domain ({AD).} The Setubal Workshop report provided conceptual guidance on defining a ({Q)SAR} {AD}, but it is difficult to use directly. The practical application of the {AD} concept requires an operational definition that permits the design of an automatic (computerised), quantitative procedure to determine a models {AD.} An attempt is made to address this need, and methods and criteria for estimating {AD} through training set interpolation in descriptor space are reviewed. It is proposed that response space should be included in the training set representation. Thus, training set chemicals are points in n-dimensional descriptor space and m-dimensional model response space. Four major approaches for estimating interpolation regions in a multivariate space are reviewed and compared: range, distance, geometrical, and probability density distribution.},

doi = {10.1021/ci049782w},
abstract = {How well can a {QSAR} model predict the activity of a molecule not in the training set used to create the model? A set of retrospective cross-validation experiments using 20 diverse in-house activity sets were done to find a good discriminator of prediction accuracy as measured by root-mean-square difference between observed and predicted activity. Among the measures we tested, two seem useful: the similarity of the molecule to be predicted to the nearest molecule in the training set and/or the number of neighbors in the training set, where neighbors are those more similar than a user-chosen cutoff. The molecules with the highest similarity and/or the most neighbors are the best-predicted. This trend holds true for narrow training sets and, to a lesser degree, for many diverse training sets and does not depend on which {QSAR} method or descriptor is used. One may define the similarity using a different descriptor than that used for the {QSAR} model. The similarity dependence for diverse training sets is somewhat unexpected. It appears to be greater for those data sets where the association of similar activities vs similar structures (as encoded in the Patterson plot) is stronger. We propose a way to estimate the reliability of the prediction of an arbitrary chemical structure on a given {QSAR} model, given the training set from which the model was derived.},

abstract = {The biochemical half maximal inhibitory concentration ({IC50)} is the most commonly used metric for on-target activity in lead optimization. It is used to guide lead optimization, build large-scale chemogenomics analysis, off-target activity and toxicity models based on public data. However, the use of public biochemical {IC50} data is problematic, because they are assay specific and comparable only under certain conditions. For large scale analysis it is not feasible to check each data entry manually and it is very tempting to mix all available {IC50} values from public database even if assay information is not reported. As previously reported for Ki database analysis, we first analyzed the types of errors, the redundancy and the variability that can be found in {ChEMBL} {IC50} database. For assessing the variability of {IC50} data independently measured in two different labs at least ten {IC50} data for identical protein-ligand systems against the same target were searched in {ChEMBL.} As a not sufficient number of cases of this type are available, the variability of {IC50} data was assessed by comparing all pairs of independent {IC50} measurements on identical protein-ligand systems. The standard deviation of {IC50} data is only 25\% larger than the standard deviation of Ki data, suggesting that mixing {IC50} data from different assays, even not knowing assay conditions details, only adds a moderate amount of noise to the overall data. The standard deviation of public {ChEMBL} {IC50} data, as expected, resulted greater than the standard deviation of in-house intra-laboratory/inter-day {IC50} data. Augmenting mixed public {IC50} data by public Ki data does not deteriorate the quality of the mixed {IC50} data, if the Ki is corrected by an offset. For a broad dataset such as {ChEMBL} database a Ki- {IC50} conversion factor of 2 was found to be the most reasonable.},

Another significant challenge to realizing the full potential of computational models is their integration into prospective medicinal chemistry campaigns.

We extend such classifiers to handle data with uncertain information, which originates from measurement/quantisation errors, data staleness, multiple repeated measurements, etc. The value uncertainty is represented by multiple values forming a probability distribution function (pdf). We discover that the accuracy of a decision tree classifier can be much improved if the whole pdf, rather than a simple statistic, is taken into account. We extend classical decision tree building algorithms to handle data tuples with uncertain values. Since processing pdf's is computationally more costly, we propose a series of pruning techniques that can greatly improve the efficiency of the construction of decision trees.},

abstract = {Quantitative predictions in computational life sciences are often based on regression models. The advent of machine learning has led to highly accurate regression models that have gained widespread acceptance. While there are statistical methods available to estimate the global performance of regression models on a test or training dataset, it is often not clear how well this performance transfers to other datasets or how reliable an individual prediction is–a fact that often reduces a user’s trust into a computational method. In analogy to the concept of an experimental error, we sketch how estimators for individual prediction errors can be used to provide confidence intervals for individual predictions. Two novel statistical methods, named {CONFINE} and {CONFIVE}, can estimate the reliability of an individual prediction based on the local properties of nearby training data. The methods can be applied equally to linear and non-linear regression methods with very little computational overhead. We compare our confidence estimators with other existing confidence and applicability domain estimators on two biologically relevant problems ({MHC–peptide} binding prediction and quantitative structure-activity relationship ({QSAR)).} Our results suggest that the proposed confidence estimators perform comparable to or better than previously proposed estimation methods. Given a sufficient amount of training data, the estimators exhibit error estimates of high quality. In addition, we observed that the quality of estimated confidence intervals is predictable. We discuss how confidence estimation is influenced by noise, the number of features, and the dataset size. Estimating the confidence in individual prediction in terms of error intervals represents an important step from plain, non-informative predictions towards transparent and interpretable predictions that will help to improve the acceptance of computational methods in the biological community.},

doi = {10.1101/gr.4573206},
abstract = {Many thousands of proteins encoded by the genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causal organism of the deadliest form of human malaria, are of unknown function. It is of utmost importance that these proteins be characterized if we are to develop combative strategies against malaria based on the biology of the parasite. In an attempt to infer protein function on a genome-wide scale, we computationally modeled the P. falciparum interactome, elucidating local and global functional relationships between gene products. The resulting interaction network, reconstructed by integrating in silico and experimental functional genomics data within a Bayesian framework, covers approximately 68\% of the parasite genome and provides functional inferences for more than 2000 uncharacterized proteins, based on their associations. Network reconstruction involved the use of a novel strategy, where we incorporated continuously updated, uniform reference priors in our Bayesian model. This method for generating interaction maps is thus also well suited for application to other genomes, where pre-existing interactome knowledge is sparse. Additionally, we superimposed this map on genomes of three apicomplexan pathogens--Plasmodium yoelii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium parvum--describing relationships between these organisms based on retained functional linkages. This comparison provided a glimpse of the highly evolved nature of P. falciparum; for instance, a deficit of nearly 26\% in terms of predicted interactions is observed against P. yoelii, because of missing ortholog partners in pairs of functionally linked proteins.},

abstract = {Motivation: Certain chemical substructures are present in many drugs. This has led to the claim of ‘privileged’ substructures which are predisposed to bioactivity. Because bias in screening library construction could explain this phenomenon, the existence of privilege has been controversial.
Results: Using diverse phenotypic assays, we defined bioactivity for multiple compound libraries. Many substructures were associated with bioactivity even after accounting for substructure prevalence in the library, thus validating the privileged substructure concept. Determinations of privilege were confirmed in independent assays and libraries. Our analysis also revealed ‘underprivileged’ substructures and ‘conditional privilege’—rules relating combinations of substructure to bioactivity. Most previously reported substructures have been flat aromatic ring systems. Although we validated such substructures, we also identified three-dimensional privileged substructures. Most privileged substructures display a wide variety of substituents suggesting an entropic mechanism of privilege. Compounds containing privileged substructures had a doubled rate of bioactivity, suggesting practical consequences for pharmaceutical discovery.

abstract = {A drug molecule should bind to its target with high affinity and selectivity. Since the binding affinity is a combined function of the binding enthalpy and the binding entropy, extremely high affinity requires that both terms contribute favorably to binding. The binding enthalpy, however, is notoriously more difficult to optimize than the binding entropy, a fact that has resulted in thermodynamically-unbalanced molecules that do not achieve optimal potency. In fact, with current technologies, the enthalpic optimization of drug candidates may take years and only appear in second-generation products. Within that context, it is not surprising that structure/activity relationships ({SAR)} that explicitly incorporate the interplay between enthalpy and entropy and accelerate the optimization process are being developed and gaining popularity.},

abstract = {High throughput screening and other techniques commonly used to identify lead candidates for drug development usually yield compounds with binding affinities to their intended targets in the mid-micromolar range. The affinity of these molecules needs to be improved by several orders of magnitude before they become viable drug candidates. Traditionally, this task has been accomplished by establishing structure activity relationships ({SAR)} in order to guide chemical modifications and improve the binding affinity of the compounds. Since the binding affinity is a function of two quantities, the binding enthalpy and the binding entropy, it is evident that a more efficient optimization would be accomplished if both quantities were considered and improved simultaneously. Here, an optimization algorithm based upon enthalpic and entropic information generated by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ({ITC)} is presented.},

abstract = {In quite a few diseases, drug resistance due to target variability poses a serious problem in pharmacotherapy. This is certainly true for {HIV}, and hence, it is often unknown which drug is best to use or to develop against an individual {HIV} strain. In this work we applied ‘proteochemometric’ modeling of {HIV} Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase ({NNRTI)} inhibitors to support preclinical development by predicting compound performance on multiple mutants in the lead selection stage. Proteochemometric models are based on both small molecule and target properties and can thus capture multi-target activity relationships simultaneously, the targets in this case being a set of 14 {HIV} Reverse Transcriptase ({RT)} mutants. We validated our model by experimentally confirming model predictions for 317 untested compound – mutant pairs, with a prediction error comparable with assay variability ({RMSE} 0.62). Furthermore, dependent on the similarity of a new mutant to the training set, we could predict with high accuracy which compound will be most effective on a sequence with a previously unknown genotype. Hence, our models allow the evaluation of compound performance on untested sequences and the selection of the most promising leads for further preclinical research. The modeling concept is likely to be applicable also to other target families with genetic variability like other viruses or bacteria, or with similar orthologs like {GPCRs.}},

doi = {10.1016/j.gene.2012.11.061},
abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs)} are the most frequently addressed drug targets in the pharmaceutical industry. However, achieving highly safety and efficacy in designing of {GPCR} drugs is quite challenging since their primary amino acid sequences show fairly high homology. Systematic study on the interaction spectra of inhibitors with multiple human {GPCRs} will shed light on how to design the inhibitors for different diseases which are related to {GPCRs.} To reach this goal, several proteochemometric models were constructed based on different combinations of two protein descriptors, two ligand descriptors and one ligand-receptor cross-term by two kinds of statistical learning techniques. Our results show that support vector regression ({SVR)} performs better than Gaussian processes ({GP)} for most combinations of descriptors. The transmembrane ({TM)} identity descriptors have more powerful ability than the z-scale descriptors in the characterization of {GPCRs.} Furthermore, the performance of our {PCM} models was not improved by introducing the cross-terms. Finally, based on the {TM} Identity descriptors and 28-dimensional drug-like index, two best {PCM} models with {GP} and {SVR} ({GP-S-DLI:} R(2)=0.9345, Q(2)test=0.7441; {SVR-S-DLI:} R(2)=1.0000, Q(2)test=0.7423) were derived respectively. The area of {ROC} curve was 0.8940 when an external test set was used, which indicates that our {PCM} model obtained a powerful capability for predicting new interactions between {GPCRs} and ligands. Our results indicate that the derived best model has a high predictive ability for human {GPCR-inhibitor} interactions. It can be potentially used to discover novel multi-target or specific inhibitors of {GPCRs} with higher efficacy and fewer side effects.},

This huge interaction matrix is only sparsely filled with experimental data but can be complemented by predicted values for selected ligand–target pairs. The prediction by computational chemogenomics uses the similarity principle that states that similar compounds have similar properties and that targets with similar binding sites bind similar ligands. Chemogenomics has a number of interesting applications, e.g. the prediction of the bioprofile of drugs including an assessment of possible adverse drug effects or the support of phenotypic screening by target fishing.

Applications span a wide range, from the 'designed polypharmacology' of compounds to mode-of-action analysis. In this review, we firstly survey databases that can be used for ligand-based target prediction and which have grown tremendously in size in the past. We furthermore outline methods for target prediction that exist, both based on the knowledge of bioactivities from the ligand side and methods that can be applied in situations when a protein structure is known. Applications of successful in silico target identification attempts are discussed in detail, which were based partly or in whole on computational target predictions in the first instance. This includes the authors' own experience using target prediction tools, in this case considering phenotypic antibacterial screens and the analysis of high-throughput screening data. Finally, we will conclude with the prospective application of databases to not only predict, retrospectively, the protein targets of a small molecule, but also how to design ligands with desired polypharmacology in a prospective manner.},

Using a hybrid parallelization approach that uses both threading (shared memory) and message-passing (distributed memory), we implement the core linear algebra operations used in spatial statistics and Gaussian process regression in an R package called {bigGP} that relies on C and {MPI.} The approach divides the matrix into blocks such that the computational load is balanced across processes while communication between processes is limited. The package provides an {API} enabling R programmers to implement Gaussian process-based methods by using the distributed linear algebra operations without any C or {MPI} coding. We illustrate the approach and software by analyzing an astrophysics dataset with n=67,275 observations.},

In this review, we discuss the computational methods for building {QSAR} models. We start with outlining their usefulness in high-throughput screening and identifying the general scheme of a {QSAR} model. Following, we focus on the methodologies in constructing three main components of {QSAR} model, namely the methods for describing the molecular structure of compounds, for selection of informative descriptors and for activity prediction.

Recently, chromosome conformation capture based technologies, such as Hi-C and {TCC}, have been developed to provide a genome-wide, high resolution and three-dimensional ({3D)} view of chromatin organization. However, statistical methods for analyzing these data are still under development. Here we propose two Bayesian methods, {BACH} to infer the consensus {3D} chromosomal structure and {BACH-MIX} to reveal structural variations of chromatin in a cell population. Applying {BACH} and {BACH-MIX} to a high resolution Hi-C dataset, we found that most local genomic regions exhibit homogeneous {3D} chromosomal structures. Furthermore, spatial properties of {3D} chromosomal structures and structural variations of chromatin are associated with several genomic and epigenetic features. Noticeably, gene rich, accessible and early replicated genomic regions tend to be more elongated and exhibit higher structural variations than gene poor, inaccessible and late replicated genomic regions.},

Hence, in the current work a total of 13 different protein descriptor sets have been compared with respect to their behavior in perceiving similarities between amino acids. The descriptor sets included in the study are Z-scales (3 variants), VHSE, T-scales, ST-scales, MS-WHIM, FASGAI and
		BLOSUM, and a novel protein descriptor set termed ProtFP (4 variants). We investigate to which extent descriptor sets show collinear as well as orthogonal behavior via principal component analysis (PCA).RESULTS:In describing amino acid similarities, MSWHIM, T-scales and ST-scales show related behavior, as do the VHSE, FASGAI, and ProtFP (PCA3) descriptor sets. Conversely, the ProtFP (PCA5), ProtFP (PCA8), Z-Scales (Binned), and BLOSUM descriptor sets show behavior that is distinct
			from one another as well as both of the clusters above. Generally, the use of more principal components (>3 per amino acid, per descriptor) leads to a significant differences in the way amino acids are described, despite that the later principal components capture less variation per component of the original input data.CONCLUSION:In this work a comparison is provided of how similar (and differently) currently available amino acids descriptor sets behave when converting
			structure to property space. The results obtained enable molecular modelers to select suitable amino acid descriptor sets for structure-activity analyses, e.g. those showing complementary behavior.},

abstract ={Pain associated with inflammation involves prostaglandins synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways while thromboxane A2 formed by platelets from AA via cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) mediates thrombosis. COX-1 and COX-2 are both targets of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) including aspirin whereas COX-2 activity is preferentially blocked by COX-2 inhibitors called coxibs. COXs are homodimers composed of identical
subunits, but we have shown that only one subunit is active at a time during catalysis; moreover, many nsNSAIDS bind to a single subunit of a COX dimer to inhibit the COX activity of the entire dimer. Here, we report the surprising observation that celecoxib and other coxibs bind tightly to a subunit of COX-1. Although celecoxib binding to one monomer of COX-1 does not affect the normal catalytic processing of AA by the second, partner subunit, celecoxib does interfere with the
inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin in vitro. X-ray crystallographic results obtained with a celecoxib/COX-1 complex show how celecoxib can bind to one of the two available COX sites of the COX-1 dimer. Finally, we find that administration of celecoxib to dogs interferes with the ability of a low dose of aspirin to inhibit AA-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib are widely used for pain relief. Because coxibs exhibit cardiovascular side effects, they
are often prescribed in combination with low-dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis. Our studies predict that the cardioprotective effect of low-dose aspirin on COX-1 may be blunted when taken with coxibs.},

abstract = {Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that derivatization of the carboxylate moiety in substrate analogue inhibitors, such as 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, and in nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)}, such as indomethacin and meclofenamic acid, results in the generation of potent and selective cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX-2)} inhibitors (Kalgutkar et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {U.S.A.} 2000, 97, 925?930). This paper summarizes
details of the structure?activity studies involved in the transformation of the arylacetic acid {NSAID}, indomethacin, into a {COX-2-selective} inhibitor. Many of the structurally diverse indomethacin esters and amides inhibited purified human {COX-2} with {IC50} values in the low-nanomolar range but did not inhibit ovine {COX-1} activity at concentrations as high as 66 {?M.} Primary and secondary amide analogues of indomethacin were more potent as {COX-2}
inhibitors than the corresponding tertiary amides. Replacement of the 4-chlorobenzoyl group in indomethacin esters or amides with the 4-bromobenzyl functionality or hydrogen afforded inactive compounds. Likewise, exchanging the 2-methyl group on the indole ring in the ester and amide series with a hydrogen also generated inactive compounds. Inhibition kinetics revealed that indomethacin amides behave as slow, tight-binding inhibitors of {COX-2} and that
selectivity is a function of the time-dependent step. Conversion of indomethacin into ester and amide derivatives provides a facile strategy for generating highly selective {COX-2} inhibitors and eliminating the gastrointestinal side effects of the parent compound.},

abstract = {Cyclooxygenase ({COX)} is a key rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin ({PG)} production cascades in the human body. The mechanisms of both the anti-inflammation effects and the side-effects of traditional {COX} inhibitors are associated with the existence of two {COX} isoforms. Thus while {COX-1} is predominantly expressed ubiquitously and constitutively, and it serves a housekeeping role in processes such as gastrointestinal
({GI)} mucosa protection, {COX-2} is absent or exhibits a low level of expression in most tissues, and is highly upregulated in response to endotoxin, virus, inflammatory or tissue-injury stimuli/signals, and tumour promoter in the various types of organs, tissues, and cells. Furthermore, {COX-2} contribution to {PGE2} and {PGI2} production evokes and sustains systemic or peripheral inflammatory disease, but it is not involved in the
{COX-1-mediated} {GI} tract events. Also, hypersensitivity of aspirin owing to its inhibitory action against {COX-1} is a significant concern clinically. Consequently, highly selective {COX-2} inhibitors have been needed for the treatment of inflammatory- and inflammation related-diseases that include pyrexia, inflammation, pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and cancers. In this study, a series of novel [2-\{[(4-substituted or
4,5-disubstituted)-pyridin-2-yl]carbonyl\}-(5- or 6-substituted or 5,6-disubstituted)-{1H-indol-3-yl]acetic} acid analogues was designed, synthesized, and evaluated to identify potent and selective {COX-2} inhibitors as potential agents against inflammatory diseases. As significant findings, the present study clarified unique structure–activity relationship of the analogues toward potent and selective {COX-2} inhibition in vitro,
and identified 2-\{6-fluoro-2-[4-methyl-2-pridinyl)carbonyl]-{1H-indol-3-yl\}acetic} acid as a potent and selective {COX-2} inhibitor in vitro that demonstrated orally potent anti-inflammation efficacy against carrageenan-induced oedema formation in the foot of {SPF/VAF} male {SD} rats as a peripheral inflammation model in vivo.},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX-2)} may be associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events, but only limited long-term data have been available for analysis. We report on the cardiovascular outcomes associated with the use of the selective {COX-2} inhibitor rofecoxib in a long-term, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial designed to determine the effect of three years of treatment
with rofecoxib on the risk of recurrent neoplastic polyps of the large bowel in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas.
{METHODS:} A total of 2586 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas underwent randomization: 1287 were assigned to receive 25 mg of rofecoxib daily, and 1299 to receive placebo. All investigator-reported serious adverse events that represented potential thrombotic cardiovascular events were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an external committee.
{RESULTS:} A total of 46 patients in the rofecoxib group had a confirmed thrombotic event during 3059 patient-years of follow-up (1.50 events per 100 patient-years), as compared with 26 patients in the placebo group during 3327 patient-years of follow-up (0.78 event per 100 patient-years); the corresponding relative risk was 1.92 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.19 to 3.11; P=0.008). The increased relative risk became apparent after 18 months of
treatment; during the first 18 months, the event rates were similar in the two groups. The results primarily reflect a greater number of myocardial infarctions and ischemic cerebrovascular events in the rofecoxib group. There was earlier separation (at approximately five months) between groups in the incidence of nonadjudicated investigator-reported congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or cardiac failure (hazard ratio for the comparison of the
rofecoxib group with the placebo group, 4.61; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.50 to 18.83). Overall and cardiovascular mortality was similar in the two groups.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Among patients with a history of colorectal adenomas, the use of rofecoxib was associated with an increased cardiovascular risk.},

abstract = {Inhibitors of cyclo-oxogenase ({COX)} are widely used anti-inflammatory drugs. In recent years concerns have arisen about the cardiovascular safety of these drugs, initially because of reported associations between therapy with the {COX-2} selective inhibitor rofecoxib and myocardial infarction. However, subsequent data have suggested an association between therapy with non-selective {COX} inhibitors ({NSAIDs)} and serious cardiovascular events. This
article reviews the clinical trial and population data linking {COX} inhibition to cardiovascular events. The data currently available suggests that both specific and non-specific {COX} inhibitors may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events, but that the effect varies between the individual drugs. The strongest evidence for an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events is with rofecoxib therapy. Celecoxib therapy may be associated with an increased
risk of cardiovascular events, but only when used at doses substantially higher than those recommended for the treatment of arthritis. There is a greater body of evidence supporting the relative cardiovascular safety of celecoxib when used at the doses recommended for the treatment of arthritis than for any of the other selective {COX-2} inhibitors or {NSAIDs.}},

abstract = {Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)} comprise the group of structurally diverse but similarly acting compounds that are used for relieving signs and symptoms of inflammation, especially in treatment of rheumatic diseases. Recent reports suggested potential association between regular use of {NSAIDs} and the risk of development of hematological malignancies. However, the data distinctly differ depending on type of {NSAID}
used, period of its administration and type of malignancy. Regular use of aspirin and other {NSAIDs} was shown to correlate with reduced risk of lymphoid malignancies. Frequent use of aspirin was found to be associated with decreased risk of acute leukemia ({AL)} development. In contrast, correlation between long-term acetaminophen usage and increased incidence of {AL} and multiple myeloma ({MM)} was indicated. On the other hand, {NSAIDs} were found
to exert anti-cancer effects, inhibiting proliferation and invasive growth or inducing cell apoptosis in several tumors, including hematologic malignancies. One of those agents, non-cyclooxygenase 2-inhibiting R-enantiomer of etodolac ({SDX-101)}, exerts cytotoxic effects against chronic lymphocytic leukemia ({CLL)} and {MM} cells, and is currently investigated in phase {II} clinical trial in {CLL.} The indole-pyran analogue of
{SDX-101}, {SDX-308} ({CEP-18082)}, showed more potent cytotoxicity than {SDX-101} against {MM} cells and inhibited osteoclast formation and activity of mature osteoclasts. Thus, {SDX-308} may be an ideal agent for bone disease in {MM} and related diseases. Another analogue of {SDX-101}, {SDX-309}, showed also significant anti-tumor activity in first preclinical studies. The potential role of {NSAIDs} in prevention and treatment of
hematologic malignancies is the subject of this review.},

{DESIGN:} Systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomised double-blind clinical trials of etoricoxib that were of at least 6 weeks duration and presented data on cardiovascular thromboembolic events.
{DATA} {SOURCES:} Six databases including Medline and {EMBASE.}
{METHODS:} The main outcome measure was cardiovascular thromboembolic events. A secondary analysis was undertaken to identify the presence or absence of predefined features that allowed determination of major cardiovascular events in a clinical trial.
{RESULTS:} There were five studies with a total of 2,919 subjects included in the meta-analysis. There were 7 cardiovascular thromboembolic events in 1,441 patients (0.5\%) treated with etoricoxib, and 1 event in 906 patients (0.1\%) on placebo. A pooled fixed effect estimate of the absolute risk difference was 0.5\% (95\% {CI} 0.1-1.0). The odds ratio for the risk of cardiovascular events with etoricoxib was 1.49 (0.42-5.31).
{CONCLUSION:} The clinical trials of etoricoxib provide limited data on major cardiovascular thromboembolic events as they were neither designed nor powered to assess the potential cardiovascular risks with etoricoxib therapy. However, the limited data that were available provide weak evidence of an increased cardiovascular risk with etoricoxib consistent with a class effect for {COX-2} inhibitors.},

abstract = {Numerous experimental, epidemiologic, and clinical studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)}, particularly the highly selective cyclooxygenase ({COX)-2} inhibitors, have promise as anticancer agents. {NSAIDs} restore normal apoptosis in human adenomatous colorectal polyps and in various cancer cell lines that have lost adenomatous polyposis coli gene function. {NSAIDs} also inhibit angiogenesis in cell culture and rodent
models of angiogenesis. Many epidemiologic studies have found that long-term use of {NSAIDs} is associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, and, to some extent, other cancers. Two {NSAIDs}, sulindac and celecoxib, have been found to inhibit the growth of adenomatous polyps and cause regression of existing polyps in randomized trials of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ({FAP).} However, unresolved questions about the
safety, efficacy, optimal treatment regimen, and mechanism of action of {NSAIDs} currently limit their clinical application to the prevention of polyposis in {FAP} patients. Moreover, the development of safe and effective drugs for chemoprevention is complicated by the potential of even rare, serious toxicity to offset the benefit of treatment, particularly when the drug is administered to healthy people who have low annual risk of developing the
disease for which treatment is intended. This review considers generic approaches to improve the balance between benefits and risks associated with the use of {NSAIDs} in chemoprevention. We critically examine the published experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic literature on {NSAIDs} and cancer, especially that regarding colorectal cancer, and identify strategies to overcome the various logistic and scientific barriers that impede clinical trials of
{NSAIDs} for cancer prevention. Finally, we suggest research opportunities that may help to accelerate the future clinical application of {NSAIDs} for cancer prevention or treatment.},

abstract = {Although it is often assumed that the antitumor effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)} are due to inhibition of cyclooxgenase ({COX)} activity, specifically {COX-2}, there is accumulating evidence that {COX-2} independent mechanisms can also play an important role. Studies with sulindac sulfone (Aptosyn) and related derivatives have revealed a novel pathway of tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis mediated by activation of the
guanosine 3',5' monophosphate ({cGMP)-dependent} enzyme protein kinase G ({PKG).} The present study indicates that concentrations of the {NSAIDs} celecoxib, indomethacin, and meclofenamic acid that inhibit growth of {SW480} human colon cancer cells inhibit subcellular {cGMP-phosphodiesterase} ({PDE)} enzymatic activity and in intact cells induce a two- to threefold increase in intracellular levels of {cGMP.} This is associated with phosphorylation of
the protein {VASP}, a marker of {PKG} activation, activation of {JNK1} and a decrease in cellular levels of cyclin D1; effects seen with other agents that cause activation of {PKG} in these cells. On the other hand even a high concentration of the {COX-2} specific inhibitor rofecoxib (500 {microM)} did not inhibit growth of {SW480} cells. Nor did rofecoxib inhibit {cGMP-PDE} activity or cause other changes related to {PKG} activation in these
cells. Since activation of the {PKG} pathways by celecoxib, indomethacin, and meclofenamic acid in this cell culture system required high concentrations of these compounds, it remains to be determined whether activation of this pathway contributes to the in vivo antitumor effects of specific {NSAIDs.}},

The 2 {COX} isoenzymes share structural and enzymatic similarities, but are specifically regulated at the molecular level and may be distinguished apart in their functions, although
some physiological overlap between them does occur. The major goal in developing selective {COX} inhibitors is to improve {NSAID} tolerability. Classic {NSAIDs} preferentially inhibit {COX-1} in vitro, but it appears hazardous to judge their gastrointestinal ({GI)} safety profile from these data. New compounds with a high selectivity for {COX-2}, especially those that are non-acidic, may be better tolerated in the {GI} tract. While these
compounds also might have a potential use in various diseases such as colorectal cancer and neurodegenerative diseases of the Alzheimer type, the possible appearance of adverse effects, perhaps renally-related, must be taken into consideration. Finally, well-designed large clinical trials are required to adequately estimate both the promising therapeutic advantages that may be offered by highly selective {NSAIDs}, and the potential drawbacks

abstract = {Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)} are widely used and effective treatments for pain and inflammation. They have a substantial toxicity profile with side effects mainly affecting the gastrointestinal tract, heart and kidneys. Although they comprise a chemically diverse group of drugs, {NSAIDs} are unified by a common mode of action the ability to inhibit the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase ({COX).} This also accounts for much of their
toxicity. The enzyme exists in at least 2 isoforms. {COX-1} generates prostaglandins with physiological functions, {COX-2} is induced by inflammation and its physiologic functions are unclear at present. Conventional {NSAIDs}, like diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen, are non-selective {COX} inhibitors, blocking the production of both physiologic and inflammatory prostaglandins. In this chapter, we describe the main predictable gastrointestinal,
cardiac and renal toxicities that can be explained by such blockade and review the supporting clinical and epidemiological evidence. In the gastrointestinal tract, the side effects associated with conventional {NSAIDs} are both local and systemic, and include ulceration, bleeding, perforation, and obstruction. The upper gastrointestinal tract is more commonly affected than the lower. The cardiac and renal side effects are most likely to occur in patients with
existing heart or kidney disease, where prostaglandins play an essential role in maintaining the vasoconstrictor/dilator balance necessary for homeostasis. The patients at highest risk of toxicity are the elderly, those with a prior history of ulceration or bleeding, and those with a history of cardiac disease. Among such patients, the decision to prescribe {NSAIDs} requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and harms.},

abstract = {Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)} are the most widely used therapeutic agents in the treatment of pain, inflammation and fever. They may also have a role in the management of cancer prevention, Alzheimer's disease and prophylaxis against cardiovascular disease. These drugs act primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme, which has two isoforms, cyclooxygenase-1 ({COX-1)} and cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX-2).} Selective
{COX-2} inhibitors provide potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects without the side effects of gastric and renal toxicity and inhibition of platelet function. Celecoxib is a potent {COX-2} inhibitor being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Chemoprevention is the use of pharmacological or natural agents to prevent, suppress, interrupt or reverse the process of carcinogenesis. For this purpose,
celecoxib is being used for different cancer types. The effects of {NSAIDs} on tumor growth remain unclear, but are most likely to be multifocal. In this article, we reviewed {COX-2} selectivity, the pharmacological properties of celecoxib, the use of celecoxib for cancer prevention and the mechanisms of chemoprevention.},

However, oral ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and
other {NSAIDs} are not an effective treatment. The {NSAIDs} may work as an Alzheimer's preventive but not a treatment because the oral dose to the brain is too small, 1\% to 2\% of the total plasma concentration. The {NSAID} brain dose could be significantly increased by delivering the drug intranasally. Flurbiprofen would be preferable to ibuprofen because flurbiprofen has 12\&frac12; times the potency of ibuprofen. The smaller nasal dose of
flurbiprofen than ibuprofen could significantly increase patient compliance. Alzheimer's disease starts in the entorhinal cortex, which is closely connected to the olfactory nerves, and spreads anatomically in a defined pattern. Therefore, a nasal {NSAID} would readily reach the region of the brain where it is most likely to be therapeutic.},

the level of the cyclooxygenase enzyme. However, many of the adverse effects of {NSAIDs} are also related to inhibition of prostaglandin production, making their use problematic in some patient populations. For the clinician, understanding the biology of prostaglandin as it relates to gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular physiology and the pharmacologic properties of specific {NSAIDs} is key to using these drugs safely. Of particular
importance is the recognition of co-morbid conditions and concomitant drugs that may increase the risk of {NSAIDs} in particular patients. In patients with risk factors for {NSAID} toxicity, using the lowest dose of a drug with a short half-life only when it is needed is likely to be the safest treatment option.

abstract = {Colorectal cancer ({CRC)} is the third most common type of cancer worldwide. Screening measures are far from adequate and not widely available in resource-poor settings. Primary prevention strategies therefore remain necessary to reduce the risk of developing {CRC.} Increasing evidence from epidemiological studies, randomized clinical trials and basic science supports the effectiveness of aspirin, as well as other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, for chemoprevention of several types of cancer, including {CRC.} This includes the prevention of adenoma recurrence and reduction of {CRC} incidence and mortality. The detectable benefit of daily low-dose aspirin (at least 75 mg), as used to prevent cardiovascular disease events, strongly suggests that its antiplatelet action is central to explaining its antitumor efficacy. Daily low-dose aspirin achieves complete and persistent
inhibition of cyclooxygenase ({COX)-1} in platelets (in pre-systemic circulation) while causing a limited and rapidly reversible inhibitory effect on {COX-2} and/or {COX-1} expressed in nucleated cells. Aspirin has a short half-life in human circulation (about 20 minutes); nucleated cells have the ability to resynthesize acetylated {COX} isozymes within a few hours, while platelets do not. {COX-independent} mechanisms of aspirin have been
suggested to explain its chemopreventive effects but this concept remains to be demonstrated in vivo at clinical doses.},

doi = {10.1111/pme.12275},
abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ({NSAIDs)} are principal pharmacologic agents for symptom relief in patients with arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Cardiovascular risk is associated with all {NSAIDs}, excluding aspirin. Selective inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 ({COX)-2} could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of thromboxane A2 ({TXA2} ) intact.
It has been speculated that this imbalance of homeostatic prostanoids might increase the risk for thrombotic events. The goal of this review is to provide physicians guidelines to mitigate cardiovascular and nephrotoxicity of {NSAIDs.}
{METHODS:} We conducted a systematic literature review to determine what information is available to guide treatment decisions in this patient population.
{RESULTS:} Selective inhibition of {COX-2} could produce a relative reduction in endothelial production of prostacyclin, while leaving the platelet production of {TXA2} intact. Increasing degrees of selectivity for {COX-2} are associated with augmented cardiovascular risk, whereas increasing degrees of selectivity for cyclo-oxygenase-2 ({COX-1)} are associated with augmented gastrointestinal risk. Some {NSAIDs} (such as ibuprofen) can interfere with the
cardioprotective effects of aspirin by competitively binding to {COX-1} enzyme, resulting in increased {TXA2} production Naproxen may differ from other {NSAIDs} in sustaining functionally important degrees of inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 activity throughout the dosing interval.
{CONCLUSION:} It is of paramount importance to consider individual health factors when choosing therapy with {NSAIDs.}},

Significant differences, at both the protein and {mRNA} levels, existed
between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. A distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase {mRNA} is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. Additionally, the majority of the

statistically significant models with q2 values of 0.84 and 0.79 for {CoMFA} and {CoMSIA}, respectively. The binding energies calculated from flexible docking were correlated with inhibitory activities by the least-squares fit method. The three chemical classes of inhibitors showed reasonable internal predictability (r2=0.51, 0.49, and 0.54), but the sulfonyl-containing inhibitors demonstrated distinctively low binding energy compared to the
others. The electrostatic interaction energy between the Arg513 of the {COX-2} active site and sulfonyl group of the triaryl rings seemed to have the responsibility for difference in binding energy. Comparative binding energy ({COMBINE)} analyses gave q2 values of 0.64, 0.63, and 0.50 for triaryl rings, diaryl cycloalkanopyrazoles, and diphenyl hydrazides, respectively. In this {COMBINE} model, some protein residues were highlighted as
particularly important for inhibitory activity. The combination of ligand-based and structure-based models provided an improved understanding in the interaction between the three chemical classes and the {COX-2.}},

The squared predictive correlation coefficient of 0.852 was observed between experimental and predicted activity values of test set molecules.

abstract = {Cyclooxygenases ({COXs)}, the enzymes involved in the formation of prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, exist in two forms--the constitutive {COX-1} that is cytoprotective and responsible for the production of prostaglandins and {COX-2} which is induced by cytokines, mitogens and endotoxins in inflammatory cells and responsible for the increased levels of prostaglandins during inflammation. As a
result {COX-2} has become the natural target for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs. While the conventional {NSAIDs} with gastric side effects inhibit both {COX-1} and {COX-2}, the newly developed drugs for inflammation with no gastric side effects selectively block the {COX-2} enzyme. {NSAIDs}, nonselective non-aspirin {NSAIDs} and {COX-2} selective inhibitors, are being widely used for various arthritis and pain syndromes. Selective
inhibitors of {COX-2}, however, convey a small but definite risk of myocardial infarction and stroke; the extent of which varies depending on the {COX-2} specificity. In view of the gastric side effects of conventional {NSAIDs} and the recent market withdrawal of rofecoxib and valdecoxib due to their adverse cardiovascular side effects there is need to develop alternative anti-inflammatory agents with reduced gastric and cardiovascular problems. The
present study reviews various Computer Aided Drug Design ({CADD)} approaches to develop Cyclooxygenase based anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs.},

Two of these models were selected and validated further, which revealed the importance of Kier molecular flexibility index
for {COX-2} inhibitory activity and the number of hydrogen bond donor atoms for {COX-1} inhibitory activity.

abstract = {{COX-2(cyclooxygenase-2)} has sparked a surge in pharmaceutical interest since its discovery at the beginning of the 1990s. Several {COX-2} selective inhibitors that avoid gastrointestinal side effects have been successfully launched into the market in recent years. The first selective {COX-2} inhibitor, celecoxib, entered the market in December 1998 [corrected] However, there are a few organs that physiologically and functionally express
{COX-2}, particularly the glomeruli of the kidney and the cortex of the brain. Inhibition of {COX-2} expression in these organs possibly causes heart attack and stroke in long-term {COX-2} inhibitor users. Recently, a {USA} Food and Drug Agency ({FDA)} advisory panel re-evaluated {COX-2} inhibitors and unanimously concluded that the entire class of {COX-2} inhibitors increase the risk of cardiovascular problems. Thus the use of {COX-2}
inhibitors is still controversial, and there is a challenge for not only pharmacologists, but also the pharmaceutical industry, to develop improved painkilling and anti-inflammatory drugs. This may involve exploring a new generation of {COX-2} inhibitors with different inhibitory mechanisms through computer-aided design, screening different sources of inhibitors with lower selectivity, or seeking completely new targets. Synthetic {COX-2} inhibitors have high
selectivity and the advantage of irreversible inhibition, whereas naturally derived {COX-2} inhibitors have lower selectivity and fewer side effects, with the medical effects in general not being as striking as those achieved using synthetic inhibitors. This review discusses the mechanism of {COX-2} inhibitor therapy and a possible new way of exploration in the development of anti-inflammatory, analgetic, and antipyretic drugs.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation
between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.
Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {A bottleneck in drug discovery is the identification of the molecular targets of a compound (mode of action, {MoA)} and of its off-target effects. Previous approaches to elucidate drug {MoA} include analysis of chemical structures, transcriptional responses following treatment, and text mining. Methods based on transcriptional responses require the least amount of information and can be quickly applied to new compounds.
Available methods are inefficient and are not able to support network pharmacology. We developed an automatic and robust approach that exploits similarity in gene expression profiles following drug treatment, across multiple cell lines and dosages, to predict similarities in drug effect and {MoA.} We constructed a “drug network” of 1,302 nodes (drugs) and 41,047 edges (indicating similarities between pair of drugs). We applied network theory,
partitioning drugs into groups of densely interconnected nodes (i.e., communities). These communities are significantly enriched for compounds with similar {MoA}, or acting on the same pathway, and can be used to identify the compound-targeted biological pathways. New compounds can be integrated into the network to predict their therapeutic and off-target effects. Using this network, we correctly predicted the {MoA} for nine anticancer
compounds, and we were able to discover an unreported effect for a well-known drug. We verified an unexpected similarity between cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitors and Topoisomerase inhibitors. We discovered that Fasudil (a Rho-kinase inhibitor) might be “repositioned” as an enhancer of cellular autophagy, potentially applicable to several neurodegenerative disorders.

abstract = {Introduction
{PaDEL-Descriptor} is a software for calculating molecular descriptors and fingerprints. The software currently calculates 797 descriptors (663 {1D}, {2D} descriptors, and 134 {3D} descriptors) and 10 types of fingerprints. These descriptors and fingerprints are calculated mainly using The Chemistry Development Kit. Some additional descriptors and fingerprints were added, which include atom type electrotopological state descriptors,
{McGowan} volume, molecular linear free energy relation descriptors, ring counts, count of chemical substructures identified by Laggner, and binary fingerprints and count of chemical substructures identified by Klekota and Roth.
Methods
{PaDEL-Descriptor} was developed using the Java language and consists of a library component and an interface component. The library component allows it to be easily integrated into quantitative structure activity relationship software to provide the descriptor calculation feature while the interface component allows it to be used as a standalone software. The software uses a {Master/Worker} pattern to take advantage of the multiple {CPU} cores
that are present in most modern computers to speed up calculations of molecular descriptors.
Results
The software has several advantages over existing standalone molecular descriptor calculation software. It is free and open source, has both graphical user interface and command line interfaces, can work on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, {MacOS)}, supports more than 90 different molecular file formats, and is multithreaded.
Conclusion
{PaDEL-Descriptor} is a useful addition to the currently available molecular descriptor calculation software. The software can be downloaded at http://padel.nus.edu.sg/software/padeldescriptor. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem, 2011},

abstract = {A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, {SMILES} format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different
formats ({0D} versus {3D}, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral formats.

volume = {11},

shorttitle = {Quantitative chemogenomics},
abstract = {Chemogenomics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that lies in the interface of biology, chemistry, and informatics. Most of the currently used drugs are small molecules that interact with proteins. Understanding protein-ligand interaction is therefore central to drug discovery and design. In the subfield of chemogenomics known as proteochemometrics, protein-ligand-interaction models are induced from data matrices that consist of both
protein and ligand information along with some experimentally measured variable. The two general aims of this quantitative multi-structure-property-relationship modeling ({QMSPR)} approach are to exploit sparse/incomplete information sources and to obtain more general models covering larger parts of the protein-ligand space, than traditional approaches that focuses mainly on specific targets or ligands. The data matrices, usually obtained
from multiple sparse/incomplete sources, typically contain series of proteins and ligands together with quantitative information about their interactions. A useful model should ideally be easy to interpret and generalize well to new unseen protein-ligand combinations. Resolving this requires sophisticated machine-learning methods for model induction, combined with adequate validation. This review is intended to provide a guide to methods and data
sources suitable for this kind of protein-ligand-interaction modeling. An overview of the modeling process is presented including data collection, protein and ligand descriptor computation, data preprocessing, machine-learning-model induction and validation. Concerns and issues specific for each step in this kind of data-driven modeling will be discussed.},

@article{consonni,
	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of evaluating the predictive ability of regression models. In some cases, model validation by internal cross-validation technique is not enough and validation by an external test set has been suggested as an effective way of evaluating the model predictive ability. Different functions for calculating the predictive squared correlation coefficient Q2 from an external set were proposed, which lead to occasionally different estimates of the
		model predictive ability and therefore to contrasting decisions about model adequacy. In this paper, advantages and drawbacks of these functions in estimating model predictive ability from some simulated datasets are discussed by comparison. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
